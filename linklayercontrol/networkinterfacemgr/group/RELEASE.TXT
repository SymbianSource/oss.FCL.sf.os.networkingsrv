Nifman E32 Network interface Manager

5. Dec 2001 (alfredh)
======================

Defect fixes:

WOS-54GM6D "Unit Test code logs need to be amended"

Problem fixed in tnifman.cpp. Also updated tlog.[h|cpp] after running Lint.
Name of esock file changed from esock.ini to tnifman.esk - this fil must
be copied to \epoc32\wins\c\system\data\ directory before testing.


Version 1.0 (Perforce changelist 05/07/00)
==========================================

Added in some API functions for v6.1 for GPRS usage.

Version 1.0 (Perforce changelist 18/04/00)
==========================================

Split out header files into private and public.  Private ones are now exported to
\epoc32\include\comms-infras where they may be used by other components "in the know".

Changed CNifAgentBase::TConnectType to TAgentConnectType as the enum needs to be public,
but the class does not.

Changed #include's where necessary to specify new path for private headers.


Version 1.0 (Perforce changelist 1/12/99)
=========================================

Fixed defect in NI_CFG.cpp where it refered directly to the ESOCK.INI file without going
through the CESOCKINIFILE class in ESock.DLL.
Note: There may still be a defect that hinders the availability of a new protocol loaded
into the system that should be loaded when a CheckIniConfig is called.  This is still
under investigation.

Version 1.0 (Perforce changelist 30/11/99)
==========================================

Added documentation and exported to EPOC32 tree.


Version 1.0(014)
================

Fixed bug where database reads and writes were using TInt rather than TUint32.
This means changing timers so that KMaxTUint32 rather than negative number means forever. 
(This should not break anything as number being read has always been non-negative!)

Version 1.0(013)
================

- Merged in changes to the TNIFMAN test code.


Version 1.0(012)
================

- Merged in changes from ER5u share up to release 003.
- Tidied up MNT.CMD, etc.


Version 1.0(011)
================

Changed build number of NifMan to 68 to fix bug where ESOCK is expecting 
build number of at least this value.

Version 1.0(010)
================

Released on to the mainline share.  Source identical to ER5u release 002.


Version 1.0(003)
================
- Changed build number of Nifman to 68 to fix bug EDNAWIR-47CCWS.
- Removed .PRJ files for making releasables.
- Removed UID lines from MMP file. 

Version 1.0(002)
================
ER5u baseline release.  Added BLD.INF.

Version 1.0(001)
================

- Split from version 510 of ESOCK
- Removed all narrow-specific stuff from MNT.CMD and EBLD.BAT.
- Removed narrow def files and database from source directories.
