Hi !

I've put in the CVS a new version of the webserver.
This versions suports GET(1), HEAD(1), PUT(2), DELETE(2), TRACE & OPTIONS Methods.
It allows the webmaster to define the relationship between extension and content-type (see WSTYPES.CFG)
It allows the webmaster to define his own HTML errors messages.

This version has also 3 new files :

ws.cfg 			-> This the configuration file of the webserver.
wstypes.cfg		-> This file defines the relation ship between extension and content-types.
webserver.log		-> This file is automatically generated by the webserver. It is used by the webmaster
			   to undelete files which has been deleted by a PUT or DELETE method.
By now, this files must be in the root directory. (\epoc32\wins\C\ in the emulator)

WS.CFG
============

BACKUP_PATH=\ws\backups\	-> Set the directory for security copies of deleted files by the PUT & DELETE methods.
ERROR_PATH=\ws\error\		-> Set the directory where the user has his own HTML error messages.
SERVER_PATH=\ws\		-> Set the root directory of the webserver.
DEFAULT_RESOURCE=home.htm	-> Set the default resource name. 
				   (e.g: http:://www.6pack.fi/tcpip/ => http:://www.6pack.fi/tcpip/home.htm)
PORT=2080			-> Set the listen port.

(Note: All the values which are not defined in ws.cfg are set with defaults values.)
WSTYPES.CFG
===========

<extension_name>	<content-type>
(e.g:
html	text/html
htm	text/html
txt	text/plain
gif	image/gif
jpg	image/jpeg
js	application/octet-stream
ps	application/postscript 
)

HTML error files
================

The HTML error files must be named as "errorXXX.htm".
The XXX is the error number. (eg: 404 Not found error will have a "error404.htm" HTML error file)
If there is no error file definied the webserver will use its defaults HTML error messages.

GET & HEAD Methods (1)
======================

This version of the webserver doesn't allow queries in these methods.Although, it will support very soon.

PUT & DELETE Methods (2)
========================

These methods are allowed, but there is no authentication implemented yet. That means everybody can use these
methods with out being authorized !!!
 
/***************************************** NEW VERSION (8 - 2 - 2000) **************************************/
WS.CFG (new fields) 
============
