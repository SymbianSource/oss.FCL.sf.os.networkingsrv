This document describes how to test CDMA with the SIMTSY

Requirements
------------
* A recent Mainline (>= build 583)
* The SIMTSY (should be in the build)
* The integrationtest harness (should be in the build)

Setting up the environment
--------------------------
Copy everything in and under the folder integrationtest\it_script_files to c:\ on Epoc.

Running the tests
-----------------
To run the whole suite type "scheduletest \itest_s4" from either a command 
promt in NT for WINS or in ESHELL on ARM. This will set up COMMDB and copy the config
file for the SIMTSY to its correct location. Once this is done individual scripts
can be run like e.g "scheduletest \itest_s4\itest4_01.

Test results will end up in c:\logs\testresults, this folder must be created if it does
not already exist.

Changing PSD/CSD
----------------
By default the tests are using PSD. To change this edit load_cdma.script and rerun 
"scheduletest \itest_s4" to regenerate COMMDB. Also, for test 17 edit \itest_s4\itest4_17.

Changing the TSY
----------------
To change the TSY edit cdma-xsd.cfg and change TSYName under the Modem section and regenerate
COMMDB.
