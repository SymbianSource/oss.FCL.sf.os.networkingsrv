DummyNif - 7/12/01

The DummyNif project was created for CSD.AGX, Genconn.AGT and PSD.AGX unit test cases. It's main purpose is to drive Genconn without the need to use ESock. It really just creates a CAgentController and uses that to drive Genconn and the AGX's.

All the legacy Nifman code is only there for type purposes. All the relevant source code is in TDummyNif.cpp, all the other source code can be mostly ignored.
