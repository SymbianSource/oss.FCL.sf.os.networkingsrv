# Description:
# Sample configuration: This or some equivalent file is
# loaded as a part of policy data into IPSEC policy socket.
#
# Map numbers to algorithms implemented in the libaries
#
#	encrypt name(id-number, iv-length-in-bits)
#	auth name(id-number, digest-length-in-bits)
#
# name
#	The name of the algorithm. This is matched against
#	the published algorithms from the crypto libraries
#	(TAlgorithmDesc::iName). The name can be prefixed
#	with optional library name: "eay.idea" would match
#	only from a library named "eay".
# id-number
#	The algorithm number, as agreed between the end-points
#	(Usually IANA assigned)
# iv-length-in-bits
#	The IV length to be used in ESP packets (this should
#	match the algorithm IV).
# digest-length-in-bits
#	The number of bits used from the digest value (this can
#	be less than actual digest length).
#
# (note: these comments may make the policy too long for
# default socket buffer, so you may have to trim these off).
