This might come handy when user certificates(linux_trans-user.cer and similar) expire. Here are the steps assuming that you have openssl installed on your machine:

1-User keys(linux_trans-user.key in this example) are encryped using a PCKS#5 v.2 cipher. To decrypt them use:

	openssl pkcs8 -in linux_trans-user.key -inform der -out linux_trans-user.pem

This will ask you a password. Type in "pinkcloud"

2-Create a new request by:
	
	 openssl req -new -key linux_trans-user.pem -out req.pem -config selfsigned.cfg

You can find selfsigned.cfg in the same directory.

3-Generate the certificate:

	openssl x509 -req -in req.pem -signkey linux_trans-user.pem -outform der -out linux_trans-user.cer -days 3650


And that's it you'll get a new linux_trans-user.cer in your working directory.
