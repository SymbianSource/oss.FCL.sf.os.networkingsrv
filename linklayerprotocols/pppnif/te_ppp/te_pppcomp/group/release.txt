PPP compression and decompression test harness

script file exported to epoc32/c/ts_pppcomp.script

ts_pppcomp.script specifies which tests are run
by giving a list of ini file which run compress or decompress

compression type is specified in ini file after the key word [COMP]
source file is specified in ini file after the key word [SOURCE]
the source file is the original file in compress test case or the compressed file 
in the decompress test case
dest file is specified in ini file after the key word [DEST]
the destination file is 
- in compress case: the compressed data which will be used as a reference.
  the result of the compression test will be compared to this file. If there is any difference
  a file with the same name plus "." + COMPRESION TYPE appended to the name, will be created.
  The user can then compare the 2 files.
- in  decompress case: the original file with non compressed data. This will be
  used as a reference and the result of the decompression will be compared to this file.
  If there is any difference
    a file with the same name plus ".DE" + COMPRESION TYPE appended to the name, will be created.
  The user can then compare the 2 files.
