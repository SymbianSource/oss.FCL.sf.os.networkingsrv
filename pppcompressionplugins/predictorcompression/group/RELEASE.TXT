Release notes form PREDCOMP

Release
=======
08 April 2004

Implemented a number of performance optimizations, including avoiding a buffer
copy in the buffer flatten code when the input buffer fits in a single MBuf,
and avoiding the unnecessary zeroing of the compressed buffer.  Fixed a
problem that could result in a buffer overflow.  Fixed a number of lint
warnings.  Added some Doxygen comments.
