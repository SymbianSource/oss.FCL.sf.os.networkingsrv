PRJ_TESTMMPFILES
// specify the .mmp files required for building any test programs here
//
// You can specify "manual" to denote that a test should be listed in a
// generated batch file for running a group of tests
// which require user input during testing.
// You can specify "support" to denote that a file is a test support file
// and shouldn't be listed in a batch file for running a group of tests
// By default, each test will be listed in a batch file for running a group
// of tests which can be left to run without requiring watching over
// by the person running the tests, i.e. tests where no user
// input is required.  The default will apply if neither "manual"
// or "support" is specified.
