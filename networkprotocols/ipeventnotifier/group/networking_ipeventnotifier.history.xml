    <description>Adding new tcpip.ini ipv4linklocal option 3 - EVLL4ConfigDaemonControlled.  The configuration daemon (e.g., DHCP) now automatically configures an IPv4 linklocal address on demand if address assignment or lease renewal fails.  This is enables us to avoid creating and announcing a linklocal during initial DHCP address assignment which otherwise seems to confuse some routers&#x2019; DAD detection logic and could cause assignment to fail.</description>
