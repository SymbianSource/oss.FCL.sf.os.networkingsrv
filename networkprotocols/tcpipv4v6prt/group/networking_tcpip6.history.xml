    <description>Adding new KSoIp6InterfaceUnicastHops flow option so interface TTL can be retrieved excluding the effect of any socket options.  If no interface has been selected for the flow, the TCP/IP 6 stack default value will be returned.  This value is used to set the correct TTL for the outer packet header in ipsec ipip_eng6.cpp.</description>

    <description>Adding new tcpip.ini ipv4linklocal option 3 - EVLL4ConfigDaemonControlled.  The configuration daemon (e.g., DHCP) now automatically configures an IPv4 linklocal address on demand if address assignment or lease renewal fails.  This is enables us to avoid creating and announcing a linklocal during initial DHCP address assignment which otherwise seems to confuse some routers&#x2019; DAD detection logic and could cause assignment to fail.</description>
