Exasap

This plugin binds to IP protocol. It is started
when the first socket to this protocol is openend and
destroyed when the last socket is closed.
It will receive all forwarded packets and
passes copy of them to all reading sockets for this
protocol. This is an example of providing a socket api
from a protocol.
